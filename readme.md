During the last week, we have learned how to use a virtual globe to make a 3D thematic map. To do that, some of the most frequently used virtual globe libraries are [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [cesium.js](http://cesiumjs.org/). While Three.js is more compatible with other 3D web applications, cesium.js is dedicated to make virtual globes. As introduced in the lectures, [TerriaJS](http://terria.io/), built on cesium.js, is an robust open-source geospatial platform. It provides us handy tools for navigating, editing and managing geospatial data. If you are interested in using cesium.js for an integrated web mapping application, I would highly recommend to write the codes of [TerriaJS](http://terria.io/) at GitHub. In this practical exercise, you are asked to make a 3D thematic map using cesium.js. The major learning goal is not to have you grasp the state-of-art skills in 3D mapping, instead, it attempts to equip you with the fundamental skills of making a 3D thematic map, and provide you an opportunity to reflect on the differences between 2D and 3D web mapping. Okay, Let us get down the real deal.

In New York City, the local government maintains an open data portal to share a lot of datasets about the city management and administration. Among all the datasets, the 3-1-1 Calls on noise complaints are openly accessible. Since each complaint record comes with the locational information, it is possible to visualize them collectively on a web map. In this practical exercise, we will make a 3D bar map to visualize the concentrations of noise complaints in the city. The final web map, as shown below, can be viewed at **http://rawgit.com/jakobzhao/noise_complaints/master/index.html**.

![](img/finalmap.png)

In the map, each bar indicates a number of noise complaint cases from the region underneath. Each region is a square grid with a side of 0.2 miles. Using a sequential color theme from yellow to red, each bar can illustrate the number of complaint cases. In the meantime,  the height of a bar also correlates with the number of complaint cases.  To make such a 3D thematic map, we will need to

- select cesium.js as the map client library;
- use the dark theme map from MapBox as the base map; and 
- import the georeferenced bars in geojson data format and visualize them.

## 1\. Preparation

Throughout the term, you have frequently used GitHub as a vehicle to sync geospatial data, work in team, update web site, and publish web mappings. In thie PE, we will download a GitHub repository to your local working space. 

![](img/repository.png)

The repository is located at [https://github.com/jakobzhao/noise_complaints](https://github.com/jakobzhao/noise_complaints), just click "`Clone or download`" button to download the package, and then extract all the files to the working directory on our local computer. The file structure of this repository looks like the file tree below:

```powershell
noise_complaints
├─assets
├  ├─── nyc_noise.geojson
├─css
├  ├─── style.css
├─img
├  ├─── ...
├─index.html
├─readme.md
├─LICENSE
```

Once having the files in good place, you will need to setup a web server. To do that, you can use the  **Webstorm** or a python server by executing the following codes under the working directory:

```powershell
$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## 2\. HTML template

Above all, we will create a html page and include the necessary libraries. As shown, within the body `div`, we place two div elements - one for anchoring the virtual globe container and one for anchoring the legend. In addition, the style sheet locates at `css/style.css`. In order to make the application more light-weight, we use external links to include cesium libraries from http://cesiumjs.org/releases/1.31/Build/Cesium/Cesium.js and http://cesiumjs.org/releases/1.31/Build/Cesium/Widgets/widgets.css .

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
    <script src="http://cesiumjs.org/releases/1.31/Build/Cesium/Cesium.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cesiumjs.org/releases/1.31/Build/Cesium/Widgets/widgets.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  	<title> Cell Towers in Oregon by County </title>
</head>
<div id="cesiumContainer"></div>
<div class="legend"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, we create a `script` div to hold the javascript code. In the script, we begin with declaring the viewer. To help the users focus the web map, we turn off most of the extra features of a `Cesium.Viewer`. 

```javascript
//create a cesium view, and use the mapbox dark map as the base map.
var viewer = new Cesium.Viewer('cesiumContainer', {
  ...
  vrButton: false,  // virtual reality support
  infoBox: false, // pick a feature and show its attributes
  sceneModePicker: false, // 2d, 2.5d and 3d
  navigationHelpButton: false,
  baseLayerPicker : false,
  fullscreenButton: false,
  geocoder: false,
  homeButton: false,
  animation: false,
  timeline: false
});
```

To stand out the thematic map on a virtual globe, we change the base map by changing the **Imagery Provider** to `mapbox.dark`.

```javascript
var viewer = new Cesium.Viewer('cesiumContainer', {
  imageryProvider : new Cesium.MapboxImageryProvider({
    mapId : 'mapbox.dark',
    accessToken : 'pk.eyJ1IjoiamFrb2J6aGFvIiwiYSI6ImNpenh0dG41ZjAyY3gzMXFsdTJqbm5oNmwifQ.ucAGT19EfvxX2EUaHUwAxA'
  }),
   ...
});
```

## 3\. Loading GeoJson data

The geojson data is stored in `assets/nyc_noise.geojson`, to load and post-process the data, we use the `Cesium.GeoJsonDataSource.load().then()` functions, to make sure the data will be only processed after the geojson data is loaded. Then, we switch the map view to see the boundary of the geojson data by the `zoomTo` function.

```javascript
var dataSource = Cesium.GeoJsonDataSource.load('assets/nyc_noise.geojson').then(
  function(dataSource) {
    viewer.dataSources.add(dataSource);
    viewer.zoomTo(dataSource);
  }
);
```

Here, the file `nyc_noise.geojson` contains a set of polygons (circles). Each polygon contains two properties - `id` and `cnt`.  

- `id` is a unique identification number; and
- `cnt` indicates the number of noise complaints that came from that region. Please try to visualize the geojson data from [geojson.io](geojson.io)

 ![](img/geojsonio.png)

Once the cesium successfully imports the geojson data, we will symbolize the polygons. 

![](img/geojson_loaded.png)

First, we put all the entities in that geojson file in a loop.

```javascript
var dataSource = Cesium.GeoJsonDataSource.load('assets/nyc_noise.geojson').then(
  function(dataSource) {

    var p = dataSource.entities.values;

    for (var i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
      ...
    }

    viewer.dataSources.add(dataSource);
    viewer.zoomTo(dataSource);
  }
);
```

For each of the entities, we plan to not visualize the outlines, extrude the entities based on the number of complaints. To set up the proper height, it is a matter of adjustment to find the right variable, try different values to find the best fit.  In the end, we choose `p[i].properties.cnt * p[i].properties.cnt * 0.004`.  

```javascript
p[i].polygon.outline = false;
p[i].polygon.extrudedHeight = p[i].properties.cnt * p[i].properties.cnt * 0.004;
```

![](img/geojson_height.png)

Also, we will update the color of entities using a sequential color ramp.  To do that, we open the geojson data in QGIS.

![](img/qgis.png)

Then, categorize the data based on the `cnt` attributes, I personally prefer  `natural break` method, which gives a balanced visual experience. (Right-Click the **nyc_noise layer** on the `Layer Panel`, on the popped up panel, choose `Properties`, and then switch to the `Style` tab, and fill the blanks according to the following screenshot).

![](img/qgis-style.png)

After classifying the entities, we will pick up a color ramp. We decide to use a yellow to red sequential color ramp to visualize the data. This color ramp may give a better visualization of how the noise volume increases from low to high. 

Then, we can obtain the hexadecimal color value by clicking on the color patch.  As shown, the light yellow color value is `#ffffb2`. Then, following the same steps, get the colors for all the patches.

![](img/color-value.png)

>  **Note:** In addition to QGIS, we can also choose a color ramp from [colorbrewer2.org](colorbrewer2.org).

Cesium has a complicated [color system](http://cesiumjs.org/releases/b30/Build/Documentation/Color.html), to be simple, we use the hexadecimal color which was mainly used in CSS. Here is the API for processing a hexadecimal color.

> **Color.fromCssColorString**
>
> Creates a Color instance from a CSS color value.

| Name    | Type   | Description                              |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `color` | String | The CSS color value in #rgb, #rrggbb, rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), or hsla() format. |

> **Returns:** The color object, or undefined if the string was not a valid CSS color.

Now, we make function to determine the color based on the input number of noise complaints.

```javascript
// Set function for color ramp
function setColor(density){
  return density > 1200 ? '#bd0026' :
  density > 650 ?  '#f03b20' :
  density > 400 ?  '#fd8d3c' :
  density > 260 ?  '#fecc5c' :
  '#ffffb2' ;
}
```

Then, we can easily update the material parameter of each entity using the `setColor` function as shown below:

```javascript
p[i].polygon.material = Cesium.Color.fromCssColorString(setColor(p[i].properties.cnt));
```

## 4\. Panel of Description and Legend

Now, a 3D thematic map is made! In order to help users to read this map, we will add a legend and some descriptions. The appraoch to adding a legend has been already introduced in the map client series and practiced in PE 3. In general, we will put the content in a `div` and then capture the div using the class name, and style it by css stylesheet.  Here, the class of the `legend` div is  `legend`, as shown below.

```html
<p><b> # Noise Complaints (Jan. to Mar. 2017) </b></p><br/>
<i style="background: #bd0026"></i> <p> 1200+ </p>
<i style="background: #f03b20"></i> <p> 651 to 1200 </p>
<i style="background: #fd8d3c"></i> <p> 401 to 650 </p>
<i style="background: #fecc5c"></i> <p> 261 to 400 </p>
<i style="background: #ffffb2"></i> <p> 150 to 260 </p><br/>
```

The stylesheet is.

```css
.legend {
    line-height: 16px;
    width: 280px;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 1000;
    left: 10px;
    bottom: 10px;
    color: #a0a0a0;
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    padding: 6px 8px;
    background: #000000;
    background: rgba(38, 38, 38, 0.5);
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    border-radius: 5px;
}

h4 {
    font-family:  Lobster, cursive;
    font-size: larger;
}

.legend i {
    width: 16px;
    height: 16px;
    float: left;
    margin-right: 8px;
    opacity: 0.7;
}

.legend p {
    font-size: 12px;
    line-height: 16px;
    margin: 0;
}
```

Someone may find the default cesium.js credit banner is kind of distractive,  we can actually turn it off the following code. 

![](img/original_credits.png)

```javascript
document.getElementsByClassName("cesium-widget-credits")[0].style.visibility = "hidden";
```

Except the legend, you can add on more descriptive information about this web map. I add a title in the lobster font (which I really like), a short paragraph of description, and the credits.

```html
<div class="legend">
    <h4> Noise Complaints in New York City </h4>
    <p><b> # Noise Complaints (Jan. to Mar. 2017) </b></p><br/>
    <i style="background: #bd0026"></i> <p> 1200+ </p>
    <i style="background: #f03b20"></i> <p> 651 to 1200 </p>
    <i style="background: #fd8d3c"></i> <p> 401 to 650 </p>
    <i style="background: #fecc5c"></i> <p> 261 to 400 </p>
    <i style="background: #ffffb2"></i> <p> 150 to 260 </p><br/>
    <p> This 3D thematic map shows the number of noise complaints in New York City according to all the 3-1-1 Service requests from January to March, 2017. The data was directly downloaded from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Noise-complaints-since-20151101-w-Unspecified-CB/vjav-8yz5">NYC OpenData</a>. In the United States, 3-1-1 is a special telephone number that provides access to non-emergency municipal services.</p><br/>
